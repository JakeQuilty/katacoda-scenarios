Create a Conjur account and initialize the built-in admin user.

`docker-compose exec conjur conjurctl account create myConjurAccount > admin_data`{{execute}}

An account named myConjurAccount is created and the admin user is initialized, following keys are created and stored at admin_data file:

* admin user API key. Later on, we will use this key to log in to Conjur.
* myConjurAccount Conjur account public key.

This is a one-time action. For the duration of the containerâ€™s life or until additional initcommand is issued, the Conjur client and the Conjur server remain connected.
Use the account name that you created in the last step:

`docker-compose exec client conjur init -u conjur -a myConjurAccount`{{execute}}
